### 🐞 Hello! 
I'm a software engineer with a proven ability to collaboratively contribute to creative projects under extremely tight and strict deadlines. I competed in a 3-day Hackathon as part of a 5-person team to develop an interactive platform that equips allies with the knowledge necessary to break down harmful issues in conversations. As a life-long learner with a passion for coding, I attended an intensive 1,000+ hour coding bootcamp focused on Javascript, ReactJS, Git Flows, Postgres, MongoDB, Python, and Django. I am now excited to be a part of a collaborative, innovative front-end team focused on growth, learning, and bringing the vision of UX designers to life while advancing the future of software engineering.

Based in Chicago, I graduated from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2019 with a BFA in studio, and completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive spring of 2020.
